        <h1>Kia Ora, thanks for taking the time to view my page!</h1>

        <p>I am a 35-year-old male chef, born in New Zealand but living in the UK and I'm looking to get my first job as
            a junior Full Stack Web Developer. I am also open to other avenues within the tech industry. If you're
            willing to take a chance on me, I'm happy to take a chance on you!</p>

        <p>Web Development is a skill I am currently teaching myself in my spare time by doing the free online course,
            The Odin Project. Along side the course, I am completing practice exercises, studying curricular and extra
            curricular modules to gain many different perspective using FreeCodeCamp.org, w3schools, MDN,
            Javascript.info, CSS-tricks, Stack overflow, Frontend Mentor and various YouTube channels. The YouTube
            channels I like and follow the most are Kevin Powell, WebDev simplified, Programming with Mosh,
            FreeCodeCamp.org, dcode and Akshay Saini. I am gradually working on Wes Bos' YouTube/GitHub 30 Javascript
            exercises in 30 days as a part of the Odin Project.</p>

        <p>My progress is ever changing at a daily rate, but as it stands, I am competent in both HTML and CSS and I
            know the basics of Javascript. I will try show you an accurate summary of where I'm at. My progress is
            slower than it could be because it is broken up with my work, but that will change dramatically when you
            hire me!</p>

        <p>I have a vast range of hospitality skills and experience that I am sure can be transferred, as I have been
            employed in different areas of the trade since 2006 in UK, New Zealand, and Australia. I trained as a chef
            and made it upto Head Chef before I made the decision to try switch careers. Before training as a Chef, I
            worked for 18 months in a bar, being trained up in all areas up to duty manager.</p>
