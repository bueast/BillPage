            <p>I am a 35-year-old male chef, born in New Zealand but living in the UK and I'm looking to get my first
                job as
                a junior Full Stack Web Developer. I am also open to other avenues within the tech industry. If you're
                willing to take a chance on me, I'm happy to take a chance on you!</p>

            <p>Web Development is a skill I am currently teaching myself in my spare time by doing the free online
                course,
                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>. Along side the course, I am completing practice exercises, studying curricular and
                extra
                curricular modules to gain many different perspective using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a>,

The YouTube
                channels I like and follow the most are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell" target="_blank">Kevin Powell</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified" target="_blank">WebDev simplified</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh" target="_blank">Programming with Mosh</a>,

                <a href=""></a>
            <p>My progress is ever changing at a daily rate, but as it stands, I am competent in both HTML and CSS and I
                know the basics of Javascript. I will try show you an accurate summary of where I'm at. My progress is
                slower than it could be because it is broken up with my work, but that will change dramatically when you
                hire me!</p>

            <p>I have a vast range of hospitality skills and experience that I am sure can be transferred, as I have
                been
                employed in different areas of the trade since 2006 in UK, New Zealand, and Australia. I trained as a
                chef
                and made it upto Head Chef before I made the decision to try switch careers. Before training as a Chef,
                I
                worked for 18 months in a bar, being trained up in all areas up to duty manager.</p>

On the Thursday, I booked a flight for the following Monday. During that weekend, the Singapore airport announced it's closure. As I was flying through Singapore, my plane was cancelled. I kicked back and decided to use the time to focus on myself outside of work and like many others, grow my hair. In hindsight, I understand this was the perfect opportunity to get into coding but at the time, I was too stubborn to accept I didn't want to pursue a career in Cheffing any further.</div>

When I got out, I went to stay with my family who had moved to Paraparaumu, a small beachside town in the Kapiti coast. I was working as a Sous Chef in a local Cafe. While I was back home, I rediscovered my passion for long walks in nature and spent the majority of my spare time doing them.</div>
